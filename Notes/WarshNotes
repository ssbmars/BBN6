NOTES

System I/O for Multiplayer mode

		!NOTICE!
		for anyone not used to reading memory locations, it should be made clear that memory locations are read from right to left,
		meaning that if you see something like [00001011] the "0th" bit is the rightmost(1), not the leftmost(0).

Memory Address	Known Values		Breakdown
0x4000128h		[0B]				>binary>[00001011]
				[8B]				>binary>[10001011]

0x4000129h		[60]				>binary>[01100000]

	bit 0-1 represent the baud rate used, with the current value (3)
		representing the highest baud rate the GBA can handle, which is 115200 bps.
		
	bit 2 represents the SI-Terminal(SI-T) value, which 
		shows if it is a parent(0) or child(1)
	
	bit 3 represents the SD-Terminal(SD-T) which shows if there are
		connection issues for any involved GBA (0 = bad connection, 1 = ALL GBA ready)
		
	bit 4-5 represents the Multiplayer ID, where (0) = parent, and (1-3) represent which child
		this GBA is
	
	bit 6 represents the Multi-Player Error flag, which is (0)if everything is fine
		and (1) if there is an error
	
	bit 7 represents the start/busy bit, which should be Read-Only for child units
	
	bits 8-11 aren't used and default to 0
	
	bit 12 has to be (0) for Multi-Player mode to function
	
	bit 13 must be (1) for Multi-Player mode to function
	
	bit 14 represents whether or not IRQ Enable is disabled(0) or wants IRQ upon completion(1)
	
	bit 15 is not used and is always 0
	
...128h and 129h make up the single value that is the SIO Control.

The 0B60 value represents the parent GBA using the maximum baud rate, with all GBA ready
but not sending any data at the moment (bit 7 is 0) in normal Multi-Player mode, requesting IRQ
upon completion (assumedly of a data transfer).



I/O Keypad Input

The keypad input data is read and transferred once per frame it seems.
each bit is either Released(1) or Pressed(0)
this is stored at location 4000130h as a single 16 bit value

Bit		Explanation

0	 	Button A
1		Button B
2		Select
3		Start
4		Right
5		Left
6		Up
7		Down
8		Shoulder Button R
9		Shoulder Button L
10-15	NOT USED

As an example, FF03 would represent a state where no buttons are being pressed.
[11111111] = FF [00000011] = 03


Games use Multi-Player mode when communicating with one another, but it
isn't 100% clear how the wireless adapter ties into that setup, and I don't
think any emulators have a "working" version of the device. I'll look into it another time.
It is known  that the adapter does have a login system and matchmaking of some kind.


[TODO] For LINK multiplayer, 

[TODO]



despite using pseudo-RNG in a few (2) places, battle seems to be completely deterministic already,
the RNG1 and RNG2 values seem to be synced at some point during multiplayer starting, but I have not confirmed this.

KNOWN LOCATIONS/VALUES (some of these come from the TeamBN HUD script, and i haven't confirmed those yet, but they look correct.)

	WN - if this value is changed during multiplayer on one end only, the other player does not appear to sync up with it during battle.
	This can cause a problem where one player is killed on one player's screen and not the other, multiplayer will lock up, as the dead player's screen
	goes blank in preparation for the next battle, but the player who sees them as alive is still mid-battle. The game doesn't soft lock until the player with
	the incorrect value opens the custom screen, as it needs input from the other player to exit that cannot be given.
	
addresses.enemy_HP_Max		  =	0x0203AAAE; -- 2 bytes
		
	WN - the first "enemy" data block seems to always refer to player 2. even though both players appear on red side, the child, or player 2,
	is in the same location in memory for both players.
	
	WN - It should be noted that if a player's health ever hits 0 or lower it stops being visible, but it does continue to update. In the event of a rollback where someone dies, the
	value or function that sets visibility for HP should be turned back on (value currently unknown)
	
addresses.??				  = 0x0203AAB0; -- 2 bytes
	WN - This address is currently unknown, but it's value is identical to the Enemy ID 1 value at 0x020348D4.
	
addresses.enemy_weaponID	  = 0x0203AAB2; -- 1 bytes?

	WN- this value is FF when there are no chips remaining in the player's queue. The value placed in this address matches up with the values in the chip library. 
	value			chip
	05				Vulcan1 D
	47				Sword S
	48				WideSwrd S
	
addresses.??	  			  = 0x0203AAB3; -- 1 bytes?
	WN - It's not 100% clear yet what this value is: It changes to FF when the player has no chips left for the turn, but if they have chips available it is 00.
		I have yet to see it be any value other than either 00 or FF. sub-weapon perhaps?

addresses.enemy_Location_X,   =	0x0203AABE; - 1 byte
	WN - Player X location, varies between 14, 3C and 64 for front, middle, and rear columns respectively.
	
addresses.enemuy_Location_Y,  = 0X0203AAC2; - 1 byte
	WN - Player Y location, varies between 04, 1C, 34
